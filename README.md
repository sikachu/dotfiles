# dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles on my machine,
syncing up from time to time.

## Previous version

There was a previous version of this repository that was a fork of
[`thoughtbot/dotfiles`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).
However, I found that I haven't updated it for a long time
hence I wanted to start over.

Also, this repository now only holds the actual dotfiles
which can be installed using [`rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)
instead of relying on a shell script inside the project.
This allows me to have a public repository
to share the configuration that I find useful
and also a *private* repository
that contains configuration that are only for my machine.

## LICENSE

As the original dotfiles are MIT license,
these dotfiles are also released under MIT license as well.
